### Deep_Research_w_Google_Search
A deep-research workflow powered by Google Custom Search and a set of specialized agents. It plans searches, collects short page previews, and produces a long-form markdown report. Optionally, it can send the report as an HTML email, and a simple Gradio UI streams progress and the final result.

### Job_Application_Agents
Demonstrates an AI-powered job application evaluation flow using the OpenAI Agents SDK. Three candidate agents (junior, mid-level, senior) generate their own application emails; an HR Manager agent evaluates them and selects the best. An Email Manager agent generates a subject line, converts the chosen email to HTML, and sends it via a mail tool.
