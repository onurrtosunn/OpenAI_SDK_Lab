# Job Application Evaluation Agents

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates an **AI-powered job application evaluation workflow** using the **OpenAI Agents SDK**.  
It simulates three job applicants (junior, mid-level, senior), each generating their own job application email.  
An **HR Manager agent** evaluates all applications, selects the best one, formats it into HTML, and sends it via email.

The system is designed to showcase:
- Multi-agent collaboration
- Tool-based communication between agents
- Agent handoffs for sequential task execution
- Automated email subject generation & HTML formatting
